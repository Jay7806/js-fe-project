Information about my app: 

This is my project called 'News Bytes' which is a webpage that displays various articles and information about the article. You can navigate accross different pages starting at the homepage, you can click the quick link buttons on the homepage which will take you to a page with a variety of articles sorted by the category you choose, or you can click the articles tab which will give you a list of all articles.

Use the User tab on the right of the Navbar to choose a user to sign in as. You can then navigate to the articles page and choose an article to view. Here you can read the article, see how many votes it has 






# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
